# FOREX Prediction

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to find amazing entry/exit signals to profit using FOREX. The project utilizes EUR/USD historical data from 01/2017 - 12/2021. The first half of the project uses the 5SMA & 20SMA to determine buy/sell signals on the SMA crossover. The second half of the project uses a decision tree to determine 100 days into the future.
